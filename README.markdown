The game is written in Java, and the GP algorithm in Scala. (Although this was the first thing I've ever used Scala for, so probably not very *good* Scala.)

The game can run with or without the GUI (written in Swing) and is completely separated from the AI stuff. It should be completely usable by anyone else trying to write an AI.

At some point I'm going to update this/document things/make everything nicer.
